# Trying ADL

## Business: Trying out ADL

Before business teams get started,Â **engineers complete Step 1**:

- They set up theÂ [Arc Spring Demo project](https://github.com/eclipse-lmos/arc-spring-init)Â and start the application.
- This provides access toÂ **Arc View**Â atÂ `http://localhost:8080/chat/index.html`.

ðŸ’¡Â **Note:**

- Engineers can wire in more tools (e.g., APIs, system functions).
- Business users can also mock many tools themselves for rapid experimentation.

ðŸ‘‰ This meansÂ **business teams own the use cases**Â after setup, speeding up iteration and reducing reliance on engineering for day-to-day changes.
