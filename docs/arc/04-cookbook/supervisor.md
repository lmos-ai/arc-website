title: Supervisor Agent

The Supervisor Agent example highlights how agents can communicate with each other.

## Supervisor Agent

The Supervisor Agent uses the `call_agent` function to call other agents for assistance.

Add the following Agents and Functions to your application and try some of the following questions:

- What is the weather like in Berlin?
- Book a hotel in Berlin.
- Book a hotel in Berlin, but only if the weather is good.

**Note:** The `call_agent` function is located in the `org.eclipse.lmos.arc.agents.dsl.extensions` package.
When using Arc DSL scripts, the package is imported automatically.
