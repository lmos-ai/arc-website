The Arc Framework DSL provides a rich set of functions 
that can be used to implement complex logic in a concise and readable manner.

If you are looking for a description of the Agent Fields DSL, please
check out the [Defining Agents](./defining_agents.md#overview).

Example of the time and memory functions:

```kotlin
  agent {
    name = "MyAgent"
    prompt {
        val name = memory<String>("user_name")
        """
         The user's name is $name.
         The time is ${time()}
        """
    }
  }

```

The following list some of the most common functions that can be used in the DSL.
