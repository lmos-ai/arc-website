# What is a Tool?

In the context of LMOS a tool is an external web service or resource (device, file, database) that an AI agent can utilize to perform specific tasks or enhance its functionality. Tools act as the enablers that expand the agent's capabilities beyond the limits of its internal machine learning model. Tools provide specialized capabilities or data that the agent can leverage to achieve its objectives effectively.

Key principles:
- **Identifiable:** Each tool has a unique identifier.
- **Specialized Functionality:** Each tool provides a specific capability, such as accessing external data, executing complex computations, or interfacing with third-party services.
- **Modularity:** Tools are modular and can be plugged into agents as needed, depending on the agent's purpose.
- **Interoperability:** Tools interact with agents through well-defined APIs, ensuring discoverability and communication.
