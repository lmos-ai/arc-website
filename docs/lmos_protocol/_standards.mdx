By defining standardized metadata, metadata propagation, metadata discovery, data models, interaction patterns and a communication protocol, the **LMOS Protocol** provides:

- **Agent & Tool Description Format**  
   A standardized format for describing the capabilities and metadata of Agents and Tools using JSON-LD. This specification ensures an appropriate level of abstraction to facilitate interoperability across diverse agent platforms and domains.
   To guarantee authenticity and integrity, the description document must be signed using a W3C Decentralized Identifier (DID). This allows verification of the document’s origin and ensures that the metadata has not been tampered with. 
   JSON-LD is used as the data format because it provides a structured, machine-readable way to represent metadata while ensuring interoperability through linked data and standardized vocabularies.

- **Metadata Propagation Protocol**  
   Agents and Tools are able to propagate metadata using different protocols. For local network discovery and registration, DNS-SD/mDNS can be used. For broader network discovery, agents can publish their metadata to Agent registries. Decentralized, federated protocols could be leveraged to enable decentralized metadata propagation.

- **Agent & Tool Discovery Process**  
   A discovery mechanism for obtaining agent and tool descriptions, supporting both local and global networks. It accommodates updates to descriptions and handles the dynamic nature of agents, allowing for their constant evolution. Agents have the ability to dynamically discover other agents and tool descriptions. They can query centralized registries based on specific criteria, such as capabilities or metadata, ensuring the right Agents or Tools are matched for a given task.
   Decentralized, federated protocols could be also used for discovery, eliminating reliance on centralized registries. 

- **Decentralized Digital Identifiers**  
   Agents and tools can leverage W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for secure, verifiable, and self-sovereign authentication. This ensures cryptographic identity validation without relying on centralized authorities, enhancing trust, security, and interoperability across networks.

- **Agent Communication Protocol**  
   Agents are able to communicate using open protocols, but the LMOS protocol also provides flexibility in choosing the best transport protocol for each agent’s purpose. Rather than enforcing a single transport protocol like HTTP, MQTT, or AMQP, the LMOS protocol allows agents to select and adapt protocols based on their needs.

- **Group Management**  
   The LMOS protocol supports the creation and management of agent groups. This functionality allows the formation, management, and dissolution of agent groups while enforcing trust relationships among agents within the group. It enhances collaboration and coordination across agents in the system.
