# What is an Agent?

In the context of LMOS an **agent** is a specialized software program that **uses the capabilities of a machine learning model** to perform specific tasks. 
An agent typically has a clear goal or objective it aims to achieve. The goal drives how the agent interacts with it's short-term memory, long-term memory and tools to accomplish its task.

## Agent Design patterns

For example, Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents leverage the capabilities of LLMs to perform tasks autonomously. These agents integrate several key components:

**Memory:** LLM-based agents utilize both short-term and long-term memory to retain and recall information. Short-term memory allows the agent to keep track of the current context and interactions, while long-term memory stores accumulated knowledge and experiences. This memory architecture enables the agent to adapt its behavior based on past interactions and new information.

**Planning:** Leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, these agents can plan their actions to achieve specific objectives. Techniques like ReAct (Reason+Act) and Chain of thought involve the LLM generating thoughts and actions iteratively, allowing the agent to plan and execute tasks effectively.  The agent can also apply other techniques which include:

* Reflection – Evaluating past actions to refine future decisions.
* Self-Assessment – Identifying and correcting errors.


**Tool Usage:** To extend their functionality, LLM-based agents can interact with external tools and systems. For instance, they can execute commands, retrieve information from databases, or interact with other software applications, thereby enhancing their ability to perform complex tasks.

## LMOS Agent Design

In LMOS agents can have a state (properties), can perform actions and emit events. State represents the agent’s current configuration or context. Actions define the tasks the agent can perform, making it interactive and task-oriented. Events allow the agent to proactively notify users or systems of significant changes. 

Some examples:

* A weather agent's goal is to retrieve and deliver accurate weather information. It can understand natural language queries like "What’s the weather today?" using a large language model (LLM), fetch the relevant data from a weather service API, and present the information back to the user in natural language.
* A sales agent might respond to inquiries about product availability by fetching data from inventory databases.

Key principles:
- **Identifiable:** Each agent has a unique identifier.
- **Single-Responsibility:** Each agent is created to fulfill a particular purpose or solve a defined problem.
- **Autonomy:** The agent strives to achieve its goal with minimal human supervision.
- **Adaptability:** Depending on the environment or feedback, the agent may adjust its behavior to meet its goal more effectively.

## Model Extensability

Agents can also use other models in addition to Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs are great for understanding and generating natural language, agents can also integrate other types of AI models and tools depending on the task. 

For example:

* **Computer Vision Models:** Agents can use models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Vision Transformers for tasks involving image recognition or object detection. For instance, an agent might analyze images from a camera to detect objects or people.

* **Speech Recognition Models:** Agents can integrate Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models to convert spoken language into text. This is useful for voice assistants that need to understand spoken commands.

* **Time-Series Models:** For tasks like forecasting (e.g., predicting stock prices or weather conditions), agents might use statistical models or deep learning models like LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks) for processing time-series data.

* **Recommendation Systems:** Agents handling recommendations (like suggesting products or content) might use collaborative filtering or content-based filtering models.
